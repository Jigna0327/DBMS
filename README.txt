A Computer Database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer system.
 On the other hand, a Database Management System (DBMS) is a complex set of software programs that controls the organization, storage, management, and retrieval of data in a database. DBMS are categorized according to their data structures or types. The DBMS accepts requests for data from the application program and instructs the operating system to transfer the appropriate data.
